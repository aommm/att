A list keeping-application which keeps items automatically sorted.


Features
--------
* Adding items (e.g. 'Carrots') and assigning them a category (e.g. 'Vegetables')
* Marking items as done, to remove them from the list
* Categories are displayed in a certain order, so that e.g. all 'Vegetables' are grouped together
* The app remembers the items you add and their categories
    * For example: if you want to add 'Carrots' a second time, 'Vegetables' will be auto-completed

TODO
----
* Allow changing order of categories (Useful for example if 'Meat' comes before 'Vegetables' in your usual store)
